# Arrays and Strings
1. Is Unique - Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use any extra data structure?
2. Check Permutation - Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of another.
3. URLify - Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the true length of the string.
(Note: If implementing in Java, use the character array so you can perform the operations in place.)
4. Palindrome Permutation - Given a string, write a function to check if it is a palindrome permutation. A palindrome is a word or a phrase which is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to limited to dictionary words.
5. One Away - There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: Insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit(or zero edits) away.
